## Hello! Hi! haiii!!
Welcome to my little corner of the internet. This is where I host my personal projects.
I've been coding websites since I was 12. I taught myself on <u>[w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)</u>
on how to make websites; went on my school chromebook, and made side projects via VScode web version. I was lucky enough 
to get a laptop where I could do some real work on. I've always worked with base HTML, CSS, and JavaScript;
Never bothered to use something or learn something else. And to my credit, for what I was making, that was fine.
But, I was looking for a framework to make websites. I was thinking of <u>[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)</u>, but ultimately,
I decided to go with <u>[Astro](https://astro.build)</u>. And that has basically led up to here.
